It saves the copied text to a text file while its running.
Added GUI based code.
Now this repo has two varitions of Clipboard saver.
This Code will copy the clipboard history and save them to the provided txt file.
It can store any number of copied text with time stamp for future reference.
This code will run indefinitely until you stop the Process from the terminal window.
It is limited to just copying the text.
I wanna improve this code such that the following features are gonna added in future:-
-Single executable file without needing any terminal window.
-Ability to copy images if selected in the application settings and save the image in a folder.
-Ability to copy the filename and its path and stores it in a separate txt file when user select this feature in the 
 application settings.


 To automatically start this code we need to add the service file to task manager in windows.
